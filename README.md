# APPLE-SLOT-EXTENDER
Apple 2 and 2e suitable slot extender to allow Apple cards to be worked on outside the case.

Vintage Apple computers have a number of 50 way sockets to plug expansion cards into. 
Whilst many of the cards available are as old as the vintage Apple computers itself.
Many cards are being designed and built using modern electronics to make the vintage machine able to work with new display and storage mediums.

When experimenting with or repairing cards trying to probe a card under test can be difficult if the card is plugged into the Apples mother board slots.

So extender cards have been sold for some time to facilitate working on a live card pluged into the computer but outside the cramped conditions of the case.

I have designed a passive slot extender as at the present very few seem to be available for purchase.
