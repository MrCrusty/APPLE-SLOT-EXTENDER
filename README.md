I will start off by saying that this is the first time posting a GitHub project and also the first time I have had a PCB fabricated.

Why do I want an Apple 2 or 2e slot extender? 

Its very tight and dark to probe a card inside the case of a Vintage Apple 2e computer, especially as there are a lot of bare live parts that can be contacted or shorted inside the case and on the Apple mother board.

Thus getting the card under test, outside the case is a must for keeping the Apple well and running into the next decade.

Apple Card extenders are hard to source at the moment in the year 2025, so I decided to have a go at making my own.

I have used Kicad 9 to design the passive circuit and produce the PCB

Not all of the card is my work as
