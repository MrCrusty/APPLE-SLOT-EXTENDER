I will start off by saying that this is my first time posting a GitHub project and also the first time I have had a PCB fabricated commercially.
Why do I want an Apple 2 or 2e slot extender?
Its very tight and dark to probe a card inside the case of a Vintage Apple 2e computer, especially as there are a lot of bare live parts that can be contacted or shorted inside the case and on the Apple mother board.

Thus getting the card under test outside the case is a must for keeping my Apple well and running into the next decade.
Apple Card extenders are hard to source at the moment in the year 2025, so I decided to have a go at making my own.

I have used Kicad 9 to design the passive circuit and produce the PCB.

Not all of the design is my work as I asked contributor markdev if I could use one of his card edge footprints. And you can see his very kind reply agreeing to my use of his hard work.

Hey there, yes that would be OK. The footprint is in this file https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA/blob/main/AppleVGA/AppleVGA.pretty/AppleIIBus_Edge.kicad_mod which you can copy into your own project.

I also have another footprint in this library: https://github.com/markadev/KiCad-AppleII HOWEVER it contains some small size adjustments from the one used in this project and I never got around to creating a board to test it. So it's a bit more of a risk to use.
 
My first PCB has worked but it seems that I have used the footprint that required some adjustment. Itâ€™ s pictured below and was fabricated by PCBWAY directly from the Kicad project.
